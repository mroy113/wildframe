/// not from Wildframe's pipeline, so they round-trip identically across

///
/// Every field is `std::optional<T>`: a missing EXIF tag stays
/// `std::nullopt` rather than being coerced to a sentinel, so callers can
/// distinguish "camera did not record this" from "camera recorded zero"
/// (handoff §13, `docs/METADATA.md` §6, §7.4).
///
/// Value type, Rule of Zero (`docs/STYLE.md` §2.5). Plain aggregate —
/// public data members use bare `snake_case` per STYLE §2.1.
///
/// MVP does not re-serialize these values into a `wildframe:*` XMP
/// namespace: the standard `exif:` / `tiff:` namespaces already carry
/// them in any downstream tool that reads XMP (`docs/METADATA.md` §6).
